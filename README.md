<h3>Unable to download / Frozen download:</h3>

**If you're experiencing issues with broken or frozen downloads, there are two possible solutions you can try:**

1. **Revert to the old download method**:
   A solution could be to disable the "Download models using Aria2" feature.  
This will switch back to the old download method, which may resolve the issue.

   ![Revert to old download method](https://github.com/BlafKing/sd-civitai-browser-plus/assets/9644716/982b0ebb-0cac-4053-8060-285533e0e176)

2. **Disable Async DNS for Aria2**:
   If you're using a DNS manager program like PortMaster, try turning on the "Disable Async DNS for Aria2" option.
